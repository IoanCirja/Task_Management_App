# Task_Management_App
PentaStagiu Homework #1

Starting from the examples we went through in the first session, let’s practice on vanilla web technologies by building a sample application for task management.\
As a user, I should be able to:\
-Add a task\
-A task should be added through the completion of a form.\
-The form should be opened by clicking on a button that opens a dialog (use the HTML dialog element!!)\
-Added tasks should be stored in localStorage\
-The task form should contain fields for a title, description and assignee.\
-The title should only contain alphanumeric characters and shouldn’t be longer than 50 chars. Use a standard input.\
-The description should have a maximum of 250 chars, use a textarea.\
-Use an email field for the assignee.\
-Mark a task as completed.\
-Delete a task.\
-View tasks (separate the completed tasks from those still in progress)\
